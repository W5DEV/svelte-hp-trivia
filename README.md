# HP-Trivia

The idea for a simple to use trivia generator came from a desire to have a fun way to test knowledge of the Harry Potter series. The question pool will come from the books, movies, and Pottermore, however, each question will be tagged with the source so they can easily be filtered.

This app is a work in progress. Currently it supports the ability for registered users to login and add questions to the database. Registration is closed at this time, but might be open soon to more participants.
