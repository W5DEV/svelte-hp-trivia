        <p class="text-primary">Test your knowledge of the Harry Potter Universe with random multi-choice, true or false, or multi-select questions! Choose from a variety of randomized quizzes or select a focused topic to test your knowledge!</p>
        <p class="w-full -mb-4 text-left">As with all things, there are a few caveats and disclaimers:</p>
        <ul class="flex flex-col gap-2 ml-10 list-disc">
            <li>Questions are randomly generated from a pool of questions which have been manually submitted and uploaded and may not be 100% accurate. Report any inaccuracies or mistakes to have the question reviewed and corrected.</li>
            <li>Citations are a work in progress. Most questions have been tagged with sufficient source material, and citation disclaimers are coming soon to provide better context (only at the end of the quiz, of course)</li>
            <li>For now, these questions focus primarily on the core 7 Harry Potter books, 8 Harry Potter movies, Pottermore, Wiki, and supplemental books (lke the Fantastic Beasts book). There is additional material sourced sparingly from additional sources, however full quiz material for additional sources (like Fantastic Beasts movies) will be coming at a later date.</li>
            <li>All references to Cursed Child have been scrubbed and as such will not be mentioned. We appreciate reports of any quiz material that has found its way in by mistake.</li>
            <li>We are not affiliated with Warner Bros nor J.K. Rowling's Wizarding World. We are merely fans making fan content about factual information found in books or online. This project is purely out of passion for the Harry Potter Universe and no profit or monetization is being made from this endeavor.</li>
